##Plaintext passwords on the network

1.  
  * Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks from passively listening to plaintext passwords. 
  * Prevent attacker from trying to impersonate a user by replaying the traffic sent by that user during authentication. 


2. 
  * Protect the chat history logged by the client so that if a malicious user manages to copy the chat history file, she cannot     read the history on another computer. 
  * Logs arebound to the machine where the history is stored.
